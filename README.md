In the `script.js` file, ensure that the names of the JSON files `followers_1.json` and `following.json` exactly match the names of the JSON files in your `followers_and_following` folder. The program will not work correctly if the names do not match. See the reference images below:

If the JSON file names in your `script.js` do not match the names of the JSON files in your `followers_and_following` folder, make sure to change them accordingly so that the program works as intended.
